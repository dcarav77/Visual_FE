        <br /><br />
        <strong>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
        <br />

        Please read this arbitration provision carefully to understand your rights. Except where prohibited by law, you agree that any claim that you may have in the future must be resolved through final and binding confidential arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to a trial by jury. The rights that you would have if you went to court, such as discovery or the right to appeal, may be more limited or may not exist. You agree that you may only bring a claim in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff (lead or otherwise) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You further agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

        There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these conditions of use as a court would.

        a. General
        Arbitration is a manner of resolving a "Claim" without filing a lawsuit. "Claim" means any dispute between you, StrongallAlong, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with StrongallAlong, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Return/Exchange Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the services or products, and any act or omission by StrongallAlong or any third party (including, but not limited to, trainers), related to your use or attempted use of the services or products. You, StrongallAlong, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. StrongallAlong agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against StrongallAlong. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.

        b. Exceptions

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and StrongallAlong both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court's jurisdiction. StrongallAlong will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Sacramento, California: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents, or the intellectual property rights of a third-party; or (ii) an action by StrongallAlong for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection "b" in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection "b," the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Sacramento, California, and forever waive any challenge to said courts' jurisdiction and venue.
        c. required pre-dispute procedures

        We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. you may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by e-mail to admin@strongallalong.coach. strongallalong will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. you agree to negotiate with strongallalong or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. if for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court to enforce these terms or prevent an infringement of a third party's rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection "b" above. you hereby expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said courts in such actions.

        d. commencing arbitration

        You and strongallalong agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.

        e. arbitration location

        If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in sacramento, california unless strongallalong otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.

        f. organization, rules, and the arbitrator

        We each agree that any and all claims other than those exempted under subsection "b" above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the american arbitration association ("aaa"). either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the aaa, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection "d" above. the arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with rules of the aaa. the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the aaa's commercial dispute resolutions procedures, supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. the aaa's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. the arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these terms, the privacy policy, the return/exchange policy, and this arbitration provision. the arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. the arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or strongallalong.

        g. fees

        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the aaa's rules. we will reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.

        h. governing law and award

        The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the federal arbitration act ("faa"). Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

        i. enforceability

        This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with strongallalong, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. if the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. if a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

        j. miscellaneous

        Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except all claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. this provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and strongallalong and shall not be modified except in writing by strongallalong.

        k. amendments

        <strong>22.  TRAINER'S OBLIGATIONS AND YOUR OBLIGATIONS/YOUR INDIVIDUAL RESULTS WILL VARY  </strong>
        <br />
        Trainer's Obligations.

        The trainer will use their skills and knowledge to design a safe program of exercise that will take into account your lifestyle, personal goals, fitness level, and medical history. The trainer will provide coaching, supervision, advice, and support to assist you in achieving your goals. You understand that the results of any fitness program cannot be guaranteed by Strong all Along or the trainer, and that your progress depends on your individual effort. Accordingly, individual results will vary.

        Your Obligations - Your Individual Results Will Vary

        You must commit to your training program 100% to improve the chances of achieving your goals. You are required to arrive on time for sessions with your trainer and to have adequate internet service. You are required to wear appropriate clothing and footwear. Your trainer may require a letter of "medical clearance" from your physician, and your physician may charge you for providing that letter, which cost is payable exclusively by you. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to inform the trainer of any conditions or changes to your health, now and ongoing, which may affect your ability to exercise safely and with minimal risk of injury. If your trainer requires further medical information from a practitioner, you must provide such information.

        Every person has a different body and history, and, therefore, individual results will vary from member to member. Your individual results will vary depending upon a variety of factors unique to you, such as your health, genetics, diet, and level of exercise. If you are not satisfied with your results, your only remedy is provided in our Return/Exchange Policy.
